0,0,0,0.02248,@sorccu looks like we need to remake everything. our developer who worked on this feature is not available now and won't be accessible for several months. is it available that you accept this pull request and refactor it to your liking? feature works fine now.if not - then we will fix it when dev'll be available.
0,0,0,0,one of the solutions may look this (stf modification is not needed):1. for 50 devices you will probably need several providers: https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/deployment.md2. you can create your own service which communicates with stf using [api](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/api.md). after selecting devices you retrieve the remote debug url for all the devices.3. assuming that you have apk uploaded and devices connected via adb to your back-end you can use tools like [composer](https://github.com/gojuno/composer) to install apk and run tests simultaneously on all the devices.

0,0,0,0,"after coming back from the dead, i have this mostly working except i will most likely have to split stf the various stf services into separate containers my current solution is pretty ugly as it doesn't allow hotpluging and you need to setup config files on each device before the container is deployed (kinda the thing im trying to avoid) hopefully within the week* i will have a pretty simple pushbutton solution for running stf in a cluster thats as simple as ""docker stack deploy openstf"". like i mentioned the largest issue is i need to split these containers out to the various services and units. as for the feasibility of running on raspberry pis i have 5 3b+ for this cluster and i can get about 10 tablets running(its all i have atm) i can hit them all at once and it doesn't appear to have frame drops or any other noticeable issues. i did not need a usb hub to get this running but these devices can only do like 2.5amps each so to get past 10 tablets i will go find a bunch of mounts to charge them though a power supply instead of the usb cable to see what the limits are after i get the services all sorted out."
