0,0,0,0.6,"this looks good! i'm just thinking if we should add some info that this release needs major upgrade of reactiveswift as well. what do you think?about releases - i'm cool with it. no need for an alpha i think, and one week beta should be enough, as we did it before and worked fine.  **edit:** actually, how about waiting with release and get #1521 in? it seems like a good addition and it's already a done pr i believe.  hey @nguyenducthanhtam. i think the purpose of this pr is to use the newest changes of moya that we have in development - in that case you just need to wait just a little bit more, but the beta release its on its way. after #1527 we should be ready to go. sorry for the trouble!"
0,0,0,0.3,also updated the change log as breaking changes.  you are right. i was wondering if i should update only the .resolved files. there is no issue as keeping ~> 4.0 in both podspec and cartfile. this pr is mostly to give the latest released version of the dependency at this date when using `carthage bootstrap` or `swift package resolve`  package.resolved has not been updated. it's still pointing to 2.0.1.should run 'swift package update'i created a pr #1531 for this

0,0,0,0,"hey @canny09!can you post what result do you got when using code you included (with `urlencoding.querystring`)? the best way would be to add `networkloggerplugin` to your plugins in `moyaprovider` and copy whatever it prints (both request/response logs). more info about plugin customization you can find [here](https://github.com/moya/moya/blob/aa33a0466d7333516691b3e5212c5acb41990928/docs/plugins.md#built-in-plugins).  @canny09 i believe this is not supported. additionally, with your syntax, few of the server-side languages would only catch one `ids`, because you passed two arguments for one parameter. if you still need it though (can't talk with the server guys), you probably need to write your own `parameterencoding` ([here you have a quick example on how to create your custom one](https://github.com/moya/moya/blob/master/docs/examples/parameterencoding.md)).  this is really strange and unfortunately all of you guys can't share your project to help us investigate it, right?in that case, will any of you guys (@aloco, @karbhasin, @shwetachitlangia) want to make a quick call with me and we could try debug it on the fly? being able to reproduce it and access to the server logs would be awesome."

0,0,0,0.3,"thanks @sd10! 😁  i found [this](https://circleci.com/blog/circleci-hacks-automate-the-decision-to-skip-builds-using-a-git-hook/) article that shows how to skip ci builds if changes are in a certain directory by combining git hooks with a `.ciignore` (or any name) file. the only problem is that git hooks are local and are not copied over when a repo is cloned or forked, so i've hit a dead-end there 😓i'm still looking for a way to achieve this in circleci tho 😅"
0,0,0,0,"so... if i understand correctly from that issue, the problem was that the provider was not getting deallocated in 8.x but now in 10.x it is. but i think that in my case is actually impossible that the provider is getting deallocated, as you can see, `activity` in my example above, is part of a singleton that instantiates the corresponding service at the first moment it is called. how can it be released and how's this the expected behavior, if this is the case, we cannot rely on protocol extensions that instantiate the services under-demand. i can understand that the provider gets deallocated after a request is finished and no more references are linked to it, but *during* a request, that the resource itself gets deallocated... i don't think it is a proper management... there're no risks in retain cycles because requests from moya don't perform side-effects as they're defined.  i will test making the computed property a computed closure that generates the provider, but i don't know if this is the desired behavior... now it would be necessary to call it as follows:```swiftsessionmanager.shared.service.activity().activity(withid: 1449319201383, source: .internet)```which in my opinion is an anti-swift pattern, cannot understand how the provider is being released during a network call...  but with that approach, protocol extensions are no longer usable, which comes handy when having 10 different targets in the application...  i understand the approach, not so pretty to use that _hacky_ way, but i suppose i have not choice. now is late night in europe so i'll try this tomorrow.about the behavior, i think that i do not agree on your use case... normally the user is responsible of disposing any resources that might be running, this is an standard approach that is defined by the promises. you can either reject or resolve it. reactivex adds another tool for controlling all the resources by the disposable management, in that case, logging out as you pointed, will be enough to dispose any ongoing network request.what do you think?"
0,0,0.1,0,"@sd10 almost there! everything is correct except we don't need `convertmoyamultipartformdatatoalamofire()` now 😉 also: did you fix that failing tests in the meantime? seems like the build is passing now.  @fengerxixi hey, just a heads-up that we enabled `urlencoding.httpbody` as `bodyencoding` argument. it is also released in the newest moya 10.0.2, thanks to @sd10. if this doesn't resolve your issue, please let us know!"

0,0,0,0.1,"i've formalized a somehow, imho, super hacky solution that could be applied to any observable in the rxswift environment. it is the `retaining<t>(_ value: t)` operator. not sure if this is the issue where i should introduce this solution, but maybe this could be an option to consider, letting in the hands of the developer to retain a certain object during the lifetime of an `observable`:```swiftprivate class retaintoken<e, v> : observableconvertibletype, disposable {    private let _source: observable<e>    private var _retain: v!        init(source: observable<e>, value: v) {        _source = source        _retain = value    }        func dispose() {        self._retain = nil    }        func asobservable() -> observable<e> {        return _source    }        deinit {        self._retain = nil    }}public extension observabletype {    public func retaining<t>(_ value: t) -> observable<e> {        return observable.using({            return retaintoken(source: self.asobservable(), value: value)        }) { (t: retaintoken<e, t>) -> observable<e> in            return t.asobservable()        }    }}public extension primitivesequence where traittype == singletrait {    public func retaining<t>(_ value: t) -> single<e> {        return single.using({            return retaintoken(source: self.asobservable(), value: value)        }, primitivesequencefactory: { (t: retaintoken<e, t>) -> single<e> in            return t.asobservable().assingle()        })    }}```the idea is mostly based on the [`activityindicator`](https://github.com/reactivex/rxswift/blob/master/rxexample/rxexample/services/activityindicator.swift) proposed in the `rxswift`'s repo. this operator makes sure that the object is referenced by a strong reference during the whole lifetime of the `observable` in which this is applied.  i'd like to invite the moya community to go through this and maybe find a solution that fits everyone's needs. keep up the great work!  the only think i disagree is that how can be the `observable` contract broken when wrapping the `moyaprovider`, thing that would be easily patched by strongly referencing self in [here](https://github.com/moya/moya/blob/7c599570c2a60079dfefcc27fc67cb303feb48e1/sources/rxmoya/moyaprovider%2brx.swift#l31)  i confirm that this is due the behavior being implemented in later versions of moya. i close this but i'd like to continue the discussion in the other issue, about the behavior itself.thank you all!!"

0,0,0,0,are there any supports on me opening a pr changing the referencing cycle to a strong reference on the `reactive` and `rx` extensions of the library? 😄
0,0,0,0,"i've read the discussions, so i think that the issue is how moya is interpreting the contracts established by rx and reactiveswift, an observable, a signal, a signalproducer a promise or any other implementation of the rx contract, where its lifetime should've always be able to be **observed**. i cannot have an observable that, after subscribing, neither disposed, next, error nor complete events are received and thus, having a zombie observable, not dead, not alive.i'm with the team that the behavior should be consistent between rx and reactiveswift, so retaining the provider is key to respect those contracts. 🚀   yeah, that's why i introduced the `.retaining` operator above. that retains any object chosen by the developer along the lifetime of the observable. just expanding the reasoning to that the finishing the observable without any event is not the correct approach, but i understand the reasons of why this is happening, but i really think that this is something that should be fixed, as it is not a correct rx nor reactiveswift behavior. thank you for the feedback!!   missclick! 😅"

0,0,0,0,"hey @canny09. i'll need more informations to help you resolve the issue:1. what version of moya do you use?1. are you sure that `map<r>(_ transform:)` is a method that moya had before? i can't recall it but maybe my memory is failing me 😅 1. can you tell me if you are using additional cocoapods, for mapping specifically? `objectmapper` or `modelmapper` or any other? if yes, please provide me `podfile.lock` if possible.  oh, so now you are probably facing a problem with swift, rather than with rxswift or moya... i'll try to give you some hints on how you could try to solve it, as i don't see nothing in particular on the first sight.swift is not the best at giving you a precise errors in this situation, that's why i always try to extract the code to a playground if possible to check if the inner code is working without the rx part. in your case i would try to check if i could write a function and see if it works:```swiftfunc transform<t>(response: response) -> t {    let jsondict = response as? [string : any]    guard let model = t.deserialize(from: jsondict, designatedpath: ""data"") else {        throw blockyerror.unknown    }    return model}```if it doesn't, you have a better error right in front of you. if it does work, however, there is a problem up the chain. then i would check if the `single` extension without the whole `map` transformation works.```swiftextension single {    func mapmodel<t: handyjson>(type: t.type) -> single<t> {        return single.just(t.deserialize(from: jsondict, designatedpath: ""data""))    }}```the same situation here, if it doesn't work you know where to dig. if it works, then it's probably a typo somewhere or maybe you need an explicit parameter names or explicit return types somewhere. really not an easy fight.if you can't find it, let us know, maybe try to build an example project where it happens and someone will for sure try to help you.  @lucianopalmeida just wanted to say that this is the first time i'm seeing `rangeexpression` type and i'm amazed. will probably take a closer look on this and pr later on, but great job on finding it 💯"

(update: i just found the core maintainer already argued that way [here](https://github.com/carthage/carthage/issues/1227#issuecomment-286244019))having this said, here's the overview of possbilities we discussed until now (as i see it):1. we create forks in the main moya repo and rebase them on version updates via ci.  **pro:** the basic problem is fixed. **con:** it's work to configure once. will `bootstrap` even work after a rebase?2. we require every moya user interested in fast build times to create the forks themselves.  **pro:** we don't have to lift a finger and simply blame carthage. **con:** user madness.3. we automate the ci and use repos on the moya organization to make this happen (as suggested).  **pro:** users have all semver updating possibilities. **con:** it's work to configure this once.4. we don't automate the ci and use forks maintained by me to make this happen.  **pro:** users have all semver updating possibilities. **con:** updates will be delayed.i actually just created a ""konsensing"" where you can **submit more suggestions until sunday** and **rate the options until monday.** the results will be available once the rating deadline is over. see here:**https://www.konsensieren.eu/en/konsensierung/kd8mvrdnd/anzeigen**note: a ""konsensing"" is an innovative democratic decision making idea with the goal to find the best consensus which makes everybody happy instead of finding just the idea with the most thumbs up. unfortunately i couldn't find any english translation to the great german explanation site [here](http://www.sk-prinzip.eu/). but maybe the [google translated version](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=de&ie=utf-8&u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.sk-prinzip.eu%2f&edit-text=&act=url) is good enough?"

0,0,0,0.4,"hi @sunshinejr , thanks for the fast and kind answer!if subclassing is still considered a good practice after `rxmoyaprovider` got deprecated, then i'm all for it. an example may help, but i can anticipate that currently there is a single method in `moyaprovider` handling all `stubbehavior` cases and i'd like to override only the `delayed` one (the one where a scheduler will make sense since there's timing embedded). this method has the following signature:```swiftopen override func stubrequest(_ target: target, request: urlrequest, callbackqueue: dispatchqueue?, completion: @escaping moya.completion, endpoint: endpoint, stubbehavior: moya.stubbehavior) -> cancellabletoken```internally, it does this:`let callbackqueue = callbackqueue ?? self.callbackqueue`however notice that `callbackqueue` is internal in moyaprovider, so given that i want to keep this code, i need to create another of that property in my subclass.also, my `testscheduler` needs to be injected in my `moyaprovider` subclass via its initializer, so that i don't modify the signature of the overridden method. but here again i had problems because i wanted to keep all the same parameter default values, and some won't work at least not in a first naive attempt.so in brief, an example that:1. overrides `stubrequest` by replacing the code for one of the stub behaviors2. exposes a new initializer with an additional parameter, while keeping all the same parameter default values from the `moyaprovider` subclasswill definitely be all i need! 😄 thank you again!"

0,0,0,0,"hey @kaleemozitech, this is a tough one because there might be many factors involved.1. type of your `dict`. do you have your dictionary typed as `[string: any]` or `[string: string]`? additionally, what are `areas`? is this a `[string]` or `[int]`? make sure you are passing the types right.1. `.prettyprinted` option for your data serialization. this adds some additional space to the encoded data, maybe your server doesn't accept it at all? try replacing `.prettyprinted` with `[]`:```swiftlet data = try! jsonserialization.data(withjsonobject: dict, options: [])```3. what headers are you supposed to pass to the server? is it really `multipart/form-data`? do you override your headers somewhere? this also can be the reason that your server cannot decode your parameters well.i think these are the biggest ones that come to my mind right now. if none of these help, let me know and we will try to figure it out. server logs and more code would be appreciated. oh, and please add `networkloggerplugin(verbose: true)` to your `moyaprovider` plugins and paste it here if you can, this is really helpful with debugging.  @oluckyman this needs a major version release as it's breaking, but i think we are near to complete the scope for it 😉"
