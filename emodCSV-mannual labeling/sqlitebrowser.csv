0,0,0,0,"note that programs can request a different scaling behaviour from windows to effectively get bitmap scaling of the 100% scale version rather than application awareness of the actual target-scale pixels. you can get this in qt 5 apps with stock qt command line parsing by passing e.g. `-platform windows:dpiawareness=1` (see https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/highdpi.html#microsoft-windows). just updating the installed shortcut to use this would be an acceptable update until the ui layouts can be reworked to scale properly.as a workaround, a user can force bitmap scaling for this application manually in windows' compatibility options:1. search for ""db browser for sqlite"" in the start menu2. right-click on the shortcut and choose properties3. go to the compatibility tab4. under settings, check ""override high dpi scaling behavior. scaling performed by:"" and choose system from the drop-down5. click ok.on subsequent runs, the application will be bitmap scaled when the window is on a monitor with a scale other than 100%.        this doesn't require a high dpi monitor -- you should be able to reproduce on any monitor; just set the scaling as noted.  doing some further testing in a vm where i can more easily test a variety of monitor configurations, i figured out that this doesn't happen in a single monitor setup -- only in a multi monitor setup where scaling is set differently on different monitors.",

0,0,0,0.1,"thanks for your reply. well, as you see in my text i actually did repeat the experiment (without changing the browser version), but then everything worked. my theory is that my behavior, when adding the ""on delete cascade"" was slightly different between the two attempts. so even if i would try again, it is unlikely that i would be able make it happen again, even on my installed version. i do have an idea though what could have caused it, and it is connected to my own behavior. during the first attempt (after which the problem occurred) i did not understand that i had to press the enter key (or put the cursor at another line) after writing ""on delete cascade"". i thought i could just press save. so after pressing save i remember that i was surprised that my ""on delete cascade"" had not been saved. so i went back and typed it in again, and i think i went back and forth like this for a couple of times before i realized that i had to set the cursor at another line, before pressing save. later on i realized that instead of setting the cursor at another line one can also press the enter key, but in my case i used the method of setting the cursor at another line.  i should perhaps add that on my second attempt, working on the restored backup, i knew how to make it save properly, so i did it the right way immediately. and when i did that no problems occurred afterwards.",

0,0,0.1,0,"from what i understand, the default is added if you don't specify the field at all in the statement, so there would need to be more than one prepared statement to do this. therefore it is more complex than the case i already added.  i personally like the option of having it fail if my data has unexpected nulls, or if my table has an unexpected not null. it's easy enough to select a different option in the import or remove that not null constraint, and i definitely wouldn't want things to happen silently.i can actually see myself selecting the ""import as null"" option to import data into a not null column when i don't expect missing values.  > it's already a useful addition but ideally it should also work for non-existing tables.seems like i completely skipped over that `if` block, i can add that.  the situation when creating a new table is somewhat weird, e3e2e81a is my attempt. it will insert nulls if that's what was selected, and otherwise will stick to the current behavior; however i'm not sure about that behavior.",

0,0,0,0,"i think the option to disable automatic type detection would satisfy many use cases. if you have a file without any fields that have leading zero values, the autodetect is a nice option for importing everything correctly. if you have a small to medium size file (in terms of number of fields) that has a field with leading zeros, you can turn off the autodetect, and after import you can modify the types one by one (to convert text columns to integer or real).a use case where this would not work: you have a really large file with an id field that has leading zeros, and then a ton of columns that are mostly numeric. turn autodetect on, and the zeros are dropped from the id column and you need to recreate it. turn autodetect off, and you would have to modify the data types of the ton of columns one by one. the work around for this case would be to create a blank table with the same fields as the csv and the correct types 1st, and then import the csv into that table 2nd (by providing the blank table name at import). this takes some work, but is not unreasonable or unheard of. are there any instances when you would *not* want a field with leading zero values saved as text? in the case of zip / fips /  hex values you always want to preserve the zeros. but in other cases zeros may be used as padding to fill a field out to a certain length, and in those cases it's desirable to drop them. ultimately, i think providing the option to enable / disable autodetect is useful. it's nice to have the choice :smile: @mkleusberg  thanks! i just tested the nightly build on ubuntu and the option works as intended :smile:  leave autodetect on and columns are read in as text or integers depending on value (leading zeros dropped from id). go to advanced and turn autodetect off, all columns are read in as text.",
